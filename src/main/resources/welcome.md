# Welcome to MapReduce tutorial!

This is a tutorial app that helps you to understand the essentials of MapReduce 
style programming for large data sets. A small locally deployed Hazelcast cluster
is used as a backend and the tasks are executed and browsed via Vaadin UI. The
suggested method is to check out this project locally, import it to your local
IDE and customize examples and build your own queries. Deploy to WildFly using
'mvn wildfly:run' or deploy to any Java EE 7 server directly from your IDE.

The data used in these examples:

 * State collection: http://statetable.com/
 * Person samples: http://www.briandunning.com/sample-data/
 * Crime statistics: http://hci.stanford.edu/jheer/workshop/data/
